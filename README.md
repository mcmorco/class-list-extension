# class-list-extension
A chrome extension to help you get to online classes faster

Hello there! This is still a beta version of the chrome extension, which is why there's no 'add button' for the extension just yet.

## How To Locally Load Your Chrome Extension
1. go to chrome://extensions
2. enable developer mode via the Developer mode toggle.
3. Click 'load unpacked' and select the unzipped folder containing the code (please keep this folder where it is to prevent errors!)
4. Enjoy your new extension! :D
